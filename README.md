# Pomodori Story (Vanilla JS)

A timer based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) with a task list.

I made this to help me manage my time and keep track of how much I spent doing certain tasks everyday.

## Current task list features

- Keep track of total "`Pomodori`" finished 
- Assign a completed session or "`Pomodoro`" to a task
- Create, save, and load a task template
